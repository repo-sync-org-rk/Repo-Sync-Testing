# repo-sync-testing

## Purpose

This repository is intended as a testbed for testing gitlab and github repository webhook events as a part of the repo-sync development cycle.

Create issues, comments, and merge requests here when you need to do any "online" testing of repo-sync without risking impact to actual end-user-facing BigBang repositories (not even `podinfo`).

## ⚠️ Warning to developers

This repo is intended to hold static boilerplate content, not actual repo-sync code or sensitive DoD information.
